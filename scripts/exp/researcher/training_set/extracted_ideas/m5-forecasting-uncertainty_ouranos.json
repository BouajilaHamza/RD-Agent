        "method": "Apply Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) smoothing to the forecast predictions to stabilize them over time.",
        "context": "The notebook uses EWMA with a smoothing constant of 0.04 on the prediction columns of the dataset to achieve a smoother prediction curve.",

            "problem": "Forecasting sales with high variance and seasonality.",
            "data": "Time-series data with potential noise and volatility.",
            "method": "EWMA is a technique for smoothing time-series data, which can help reduce volatility and highlight longer-term trends.",
            "reason": "The time-series sales data likely contains noise and fluctuations that can obscure underlying trends. Smoothing these predictions should help improve the stability and accuracy of the forecasts."

        "idea": "Quantile Regression for Uncertainty Estimation",
        "method": "Implement quantile regression to predict different quantiles of the sales distribution, thus providing a measure of uncertainty.",
        "context": "The notebook calculates quantiles (e.g., 0.005, 0.025, ..., 0.995) for sales data to capture uncertainty in the predictions.",
        "hypothesis": {
            "problem": "Need to estimate the distribution of future sales rather than a single point estimate.",
            "data": "Sales data with inherent uncertainty and variability.",
            "method": "Quantile regression provides estimates at multiple points of the distribution, capturing the range of possible outcomes.",
            "reason": "Given the uncertainty in future sales, using quantile regression allows us to generate a fuller picture of potential outcomes, which is crucial for planning under uncertainty."

        "idea": "Hierarchical Forecasting",
        "method": "Aggregate predictions at various hierarchical levels (e.g., item, department, store) and adjust confidence intervals based on aggregation level.",
        "context": "The notebook aggregates sales data at different levels, such as 'item_id', 'dept_id', and 'store_id', adjusting the confidence intervals accordingly.",
        "hypothesis": {
            "problem": "Sales data is organized hierarchically, and predictions need to account for this structure.",
            "data": "Data includes multiple hierarchical levels such as items, departments, and stores.",
            "method": "Hierarchical forecasting allows for better handling of data aggregation and ensures consistency in predictions across levels.",
            "reason": "Different aggregation levels will have different levels of uncertainty; by adjusting for this, predictions can be more accurate and reflective of real-world scenarios."

        "hypothesis": {
            "problem": "Sales forecasts may deviate from historical patterns due to model bias or overfitting.",
            "data": "Historical sales data provides a reliable baseline for expected distribution.",
            "method": "Using historical quantiles ensures that predictions are grounded in reality by incorporating past observed behaviors.",

        "hypothesis": {
            "problem": "Weekly sales patterns may not be fully captured by general forecasting models.",
            "data": "Sales data exhibits strong weekly cyclical patterns due to consumer behavior or promotions.",
            "method": "Using weighted averages emphasizes more recent or relevant weekly patterns in the predictions.",
