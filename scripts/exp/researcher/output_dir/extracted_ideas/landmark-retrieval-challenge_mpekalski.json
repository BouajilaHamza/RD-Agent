            "data": "The dataset's reliance on external URLs means some images may not be accessible or could fail during download.",
            "method": "Automating the download process ensures all available data is collected systematically while identifying missing images.",

            "data": "The data is complex and stored in binary format (TFRecords), making it difficult to verify without visualization.",
