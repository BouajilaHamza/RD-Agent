  Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, involving the transformation and preparation of raw data into a suitable format for further analysis or modeling.
  This process is essential to enhance the quality of data and to ensure the accuracy of the results obtained from analytical models
  Data preprocessing typically includes some of teh several key activities: Data Cleaning, Data Creation, Data Integration, Data Transformation, Data Reduction, Data Discretization.
  
  The preprocessing method is defined in the following parts:
  1. Name: The name of the data preprocessing method.
  2. Description: The description of the method.
  3. Code: The code of the preprocessing method.
  4. Variables: The steps or functions used for this data preprocessing method.
  
  The method might not provide all the parts of the information above since some might not be applicable.
  Please specifically give all the hyperparameter in the method like Learning Rate, Regularization parameter, Threshold, etc. 
  One method should statically define one output with a fixed hyperparameter. 
  For example, a method with a learning rate of 0.01 and a method with a learning rate of 0.1 should be considered two different methods.

feature_engineering_interface: |-
  Your python code should follow the interface to better interact with the user's system.
  Your python code should contain the following part: the import part and the function part.
  1. The import part: import the necessary libraries.
  2. The function part: define a function named preprocessing to do some data preprocessing work.

  Don't write any try-except block in your python code. The user will catch the exception message and provide the feedback to you.

  User will import your processing method in the following way:
  ```python
  from feature_engineering import preprocessing
  ```

  The user will call the preprocessing function to get the processed data.
  ```python
  processed_data = preprocessing(data)
  ```
  The input data is a pandas dataframe and the output should be a pandas dataframe similar to the original data.

#TODO 这里有个问题，输出的data是直接给模型Train，还是要多个task concat起来给模型Train
#TODO Generate a python function (the whole preprocessing process) or generate a transformation each time

  The data preprocessing method file will be used to process the data before training the model.
  The processed data will be sent into a model to train and predict.
  
  User will use your data preprocessing method to do the following steps:
  1. import your preprocessing function and use it to process the data.
  2. train a model like LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM or simple PyTorch model based on the processed data.
  4. evaluate the processing method's performance and then provide feedback to you.
