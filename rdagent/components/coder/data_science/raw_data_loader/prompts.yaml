spec:
  system:
    You are a world-class data scientist and machine learning engineer with deep expertise in statistics, mathematics, and computer science. 
    Your knowledge spans cutting-edge data analysis techniques, advanced machine learning algorithms, and their practical applications to solve complex real-world problems.

    Currently, you are working on a Kaggle competition project. 
    This project involves analyzing data and building models to beat other competitors, with the code being generated by large language models.
    
    Your task is to write five specification texts (in markdown format) for the following tasks, based on the competition information provided
    - Data loading (and preprocessing)
    - Feature Engineering
    - Model Building
    - Ensemble
    - The overall workflow

    -----------Competition Information-----------
    {{ competition_info }}

  user:
    data_loader: |-
      Data loader specification text should follow these detailed requirements:
      1. Function Interface:
        - The function must be named `load_data`.
        - All raw data files are located in the /kaggle/input/ directory; therefore, the function should not take any input arguments.
        - The function must include proper and specific annotations for the output, specifying the expected data type (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`, `dict`, `np.array`, etc.).
        - A clear docstring should be provided that:
          - Describes the purpose of the function.
          - Mentions the source of the data (e.g., data location or structure).
          - Explains the expected output format.
      2. Precautions for Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        - Handle potential issues such as:
          - File encoding (e.g., UTF-8) and data delimiters (e.g., CSV comma-separated).
          - Missing values in datasets: describe how they should be handled (e.g., fill with a specific value, drop rows, etc.).
          - Data types: ensure proper type conversion (e.g., numeric columns, date parsing).
          - Memory efficiency for large datasets: consider techniques such as downcasting types or reading data in chunks.
          - Multiple files: if the dataset includes multiple files, specify how they should be combined or processed.
        - Add any domain-specific handling (e.g., date formatting, specific transformations) relevant to the competition dataset.
      3. Output:
        - The function should return four objects: `X`, `y`, `X_test`, and `test_ids`.
        - `X`: The feature matrix for the training data.
        - `y`: The target vector for the training data.
        - `X_test`: The feature matrix for the test data.
        - `test_ids`: The identifiers for the test data.

      Please respond with a JSON structure as follows:
      {
          "spec": "The corresponding specification string as described above. You should create the rules based on the competition information instead of copying the requirements."
      }

    feature: |-
      Feature engineering specification text should adhere to the following requirements:
      1. Function Interface:
        - The function must be named `feat_eng`.
        - Must include proper and specific annotations for both input and output based on the Competition Information:
          - Input: Specify the expected input data type (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`, `dict`, `np.array`, etc.).
          - Output: Specify the transformed output data type (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`, `dict`, `np.array`, etc.).
        - A comprehensive docstring must be provided that:
          - Describes the purpose of the function.
          - Clarifies the input parameters and their types.
          - Defines the structure and format of the output.
      2. Precautions for Feature Engineering:
        - If feature engineering is strictly part of the model pipeline and should not be done here, explicitly state that feature engineering will be handled at the model stage.
        - If the competition requirements or modeling strategy dictate that feature engineering must be integrated into the model pipeline, this function will remain as a placeholder and return the input data unchanged.
        - When feature engineering is applied, consider the following precautions:
          - Ensure scalability for large datasets.
          - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately during feature transformation.
          - Feature types: Ensure consistency between feature data types and transformations.
          - Custom features: Provide logic for domain-specific features, if applicable.
          - Avoid data leakage: Only use features derived from training data, excluding information from test or validation sets.

      Please respond with a JSON structure as follows:
      {
          "spec": "The corresponding specification string as described above. You should create the rules based on the competition information instead of copying the requirements."
      }

    model: |-
      Model building specification text should include two parts:
