filter_progress_bar:
  system: |
    You are an assistant helping to filter progress bars from a given text. Generate a regex pattern that matches typical progress bar formats, including those with percentages, loading bars (e.g., `====>`), or dynamic text such as elapsed time or remaining time. Be flexible to handle variations.
  user: |
    The following text contains stdout with progress bars:

    {{ stdout }}

    Generate a regex pattern to filter out progress bars from this stdout text. Focus on identifying and removing lines or segments that represent progress bars while preserving the rest of the content.

    Please respond with the regex pattern in the following JSON format and order:
    ```json
    {
        "regex pattern": "The regex pattern to filter out progress bars."
    }
    ```

if_filtered:
  system: |
    You are an assistant helping to verify if progress bars have been successfully filtered from a given text. Analyze the filtered text to determine if any progress bar-like patterns remain.
  user: |
    The following is the filtered stdout text:

    {{ filtered_stdout }}

    Check if the text still contains any progress bar patterns such as percentages, loading bars, or similar elements. Return true if no progress bar remains; otherwise, return false.

    Please respond with your answer in the following JSON format and order:
    ```json
    {
        "progress bar filtered": <true/false>
    }
    ```
